## Description:
This program uses recursion and iteration to output all permutations of a given String.

The recursive function repeatedly calls itself on smaller and smaller substrings of the original string. Eventually it is left with a single 
character, which it then returns and the stack rebuilds the String one character at a time until it forms a permuted version of the string.

Enjoy!

## How To Use:

Change the String 's' in PermuterPrinter.java to the String you want permuted, and compile and run the file.
